## iOS 17 Support

CarBridge does not support iOS 17 versions yet. This public repository is made to enable iOS 16 - iOS 17 Support for Carbridge.

## Features

- **Universal App Support:** Open virtually any app on your CarPlay interface, with the exception of DRM-enabled video streaming applications.
- **Familiar Layouts:** Enjoy the original layout of your apps on your car's display, just as you remember them on your phone.
- **No Limitations:** Utilize the full capabilities of your apps without any restrictions. Use different apps on your phone and your car simultaneously.
- **Safe & Convenient:** Control your phone directly from your carâ€™s touch screen without the need to pick up your device.
- **App Management:** Customize your CarPlay experience by hiding unwanted apps. Prefer Spotify over Apple Music? No problem. Google Maps over Apple Maps? Easy switch.

## Important Note

CarBridge on iOS 14.4-14.8 may encounter issues due to bugs in Unc0ver, unrelated to CarBridge functionality. Refunds for these issues will not be issued. For these versions, it's recommended to use checkra1n or a device on a different iOS version.

This edition of CarBridge has been completely rewritten for modern iOS versions, starting from iOS 13. It is a paid upgrade due to significant changes in CarPlay.

CarBridge is optimized for touchscreen-enabled CarPlay units. However, users with joystick controls can still use the Portal app for accessing their phone's screen on their car's display.

For installation requirements, please visit our Discord.

## Refund Policy

- Refunds are not available for users who are not jailbroken.
- Refund requests must be made within 7 days of purchase and are subject to developer approval, based primarily on product-related issues.
- The Havoc store-wide refund policy also applies.

**Note:** Jailbreak is REQUIRED for CarBridge.
